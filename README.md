# Twitter Airline Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Twitter data to assess airline sentiment, identify the most common negative reasons for complaints, and compare sentiment trends across six major airlines. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of tweets from 2015 related to airline experiences. The analysis leverages R for data cleaning, visualization, and sentiment assessment.

## Objectives
1. Determine the main reasons for negative tweets.
2. Identify the airline with the worst rating for each negative reason.
3. Evaluate the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each airline.
4. Find the top three negative reasons for each airline.
5. Analyze tweet frequency per airline.
6. Examine retweet patterns and their connection to negative sentiment.
7. Assess the correlation between tweet length and sentiment.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed unnecessary variables.
   - Dropped N/A values in key columns.
   - Standardized column values (e.g., formatting text strings).

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Computed mean sentiment confidence scores per airline.
   - Identified airlines with the highest positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.

3. **Negative Reason Analysis**:
   - Examined the most frequent negative reasons.
   - Ranked airlines based on the worst-rated negative reasons.
   - Determined the top three negative reasons per airline.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Tweet Volume Analysis**: Bar plots of tweet frequency per airline.
   - **Sentiment Breakdown**: Visualizing positive, neutral, and negative sentiment per airline.
   - **Negative Reason Trends**: Facet-wrapped bar graphs to show distribution per airline.
   - **Retweet Analysis**: Evaluating the most retweeted negative reasons.
   - **Text Length vs. Sentiment**: Density plots to check correlation between text length and sentiment.

## Key Findings
- **Most Negative Airline**: US Airways (highest mean negative sentiment confidence: 0.946).
- **Most Neutral Airline**: United (highest mean neutral sentiment confidence: 0.810).
- **Most Positive Airline**: Virgin America (highest mean positive sentiment confidence: 0.946).
- **Most Common Negative Reason**: "Customer Service Issues" (31.7% of negative tweets).

  - "Customer Service Issues" and "Canâ€™t Tell" were the top reasons for retweets (~25%).
- **Text Length vs. Sentiment**:
  - Longer tweets were more likely to have negative sentiment.
  - Shorter tweets were more likely neutral or positive.
